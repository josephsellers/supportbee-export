# SupportBee Export
A Python script that connects to the SupportBee API and downloads the tickets into a sqlite 3 database


A few notes:
1. This script was created (and adapted) to be a quick way to extract tickets out of SupportBee.
2. You will need to install the libraries that this script uses.

We hope this can be a starting point for you!
